# Portfolio

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.2.
 
This is going to be my first try on what i would call, the website development journey.

The main idea on this project it's kind of basic, a portfolio that would contain all my abilities, knowledge, and more (all in this learn and try to do adventure).
Now, having this in mind, i'll set some challenges to me.

## Challenges:

    1- Develop a way to change the style of the hole site
 
    2- Make at least 3 different variants of the web style
    
    3- Have a better understanding of the relative, absolute positions
    
    4- Evolve some bad habits of doing the things without understanding why some things are happening

Also it is worth saying that this project its going to be the final handover of a programming course that i'm making. ;P

## Technologies:
- HTML (lil easy, but a start its a start)
- CSS3 (Boostrap Framework and raw CSS)
- Angular CLI
    
Some others would be added or even deleted while the project evolves.
